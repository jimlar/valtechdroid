## Valtechdroid
This is an Android application that synchronizes the Valtech Sweden employees into your address book.
The idea is that you will benefit from getting all the phone numbers in (short/long mobile area code and local area code), images and location info from the intranet.

## Compatibility
* This app will require Android 2.0

## Done
* Reading the Valtech intranet contacts
* Android sync adapter, to store account info and schedule sync

## TODO
* Find a way to do tests in Android that is not pure pain
* Migrate to the Android 2 Contacts APIs
* Batch the ContentProvider operations
