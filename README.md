## Valtechdroid
This is an Android application that synchronizes the Valtech Sweden employees into your address book.
The idea is that you will benefit from getting all the phone numbers in (short/long mobile area code and local area code), images and location info from the intranet.

## Done
* Reading the Valtech intranet contacts
* Reading the Android contacts database
* Inputs for username / password

## TODO
* Find a way to do tests in Android that is not pure pain
* Tag the contacts as synced by the Valtech Sync
* Do the actual contact merge
* Background Service, or add the user/pass stuff as a syncadapter: http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/SampleSyncAdapter/index.html
